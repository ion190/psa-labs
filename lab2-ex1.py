# One student during a probability lecture noticed that although the number of faces of dice with integers from 1 to 6 with total 9 is like the number of such triples with value 10, a 9 seemed to come up less frequently than a 10 when three dice were rolled. Write a program to verify if the student was correct. For better proof, plot a graph with results.
