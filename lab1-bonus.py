# This morning the CIA faxed UTM the following map scan(image is also in the zip file from the email). The total captured surface is around 42 square miles (duh... this imperial metric). With red is marked the land that is mined by the guerrilla forces and at the moment they need to evaluate the logistics required to defuse the deadly mines. But they do not have enough computing resources to compute the red area from the map. Which is why they are playing their trump card, the brilliant engineers from FAF.
# The stakes are very high, and lots of innocent lives can be spared. So please compute the mined area a.s.a.p., using Monte Carlo method.
# Tip:
# The recommended python library for image processing is pillow (not the one you use to sleep).
