# Are you in for some betting ? Letâ€™s play a game. There are some specific rules to this game: A fair coin will be flipped until it falls on its head for the first time. You will be paid $2 to the power of j dollars if this occurs on the jth toss. You are sure to win at least 2 dollars so you should be willing to pay to play this game, but how much ? Few people would pay as much as 10 dollars to play this game. See if you can decide, by simulation, a reasonable amount that you would be willing to pay, per game, if you will be allowed to make a large number of plays of the game. Does the amount that you would be willing to pay per game depend upon the number of plays that you will be allowed ?
