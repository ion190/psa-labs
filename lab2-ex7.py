# Write a program to carry out the following experiment. A coin is tossed 100 times and the number of heads that turn up is recorded. This experiment is then repeated 1000 times. Have your program plot a bar graph for the proportion of the 1000 experiments in which the number of heads is n, for each n in the interval [35, 65]. Does the bar graph look as though it can be fit with a normal curve?
