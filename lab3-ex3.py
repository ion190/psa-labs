# 100 people line up to take their seats in a 100 seat theater. The 1st in line lost her ticket and decided to sit in a random seat. Each remaining theatergoer sits in their assigned seat unless itâ€™s occupied and then sits in a random seat. Whatâ€™s the probability the last person takes their assigned seat?
