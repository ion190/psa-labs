# I'm sure you've all seen cases where in a family the relatives want the child to have a certain gender. Lets estimate, by simulation, the average number of children there would be in a family if all people had children until they had a boy. Do the same if all people had children until they had at least one boy and at least one girl. How many more children would you expect to find under the second scheme that under the first in 100,000 families?
