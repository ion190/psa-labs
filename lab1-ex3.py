# One of the most popular casino games is roulette. Many people like roulette because it is an easy game to learn and play. Unlike other casino games, roulette doesn't have many complicated rules to follow or strategies to perfect. Because it's so simple, many people have tried to invent different strategies to win this game. One method is the Labouchere system. It is played as follows: write down a list of numbers, usually 1, 2, 3, 4. Bet the sum of the first and last, 1+4=5, on red. If you win, delete the first and last numbers from your list. If you lose, add the amount that you last bet to the end of your list. Then use the new list and bet the sum of the first and last numbers (if there is only one number, bet that amount) in the roulette game. Continue until your list becomes empty. Show that, if this happens, you win the sum 1+2+3+4 = 10, of your original list. Simulate the system and see if you do always stop and, hence, always win. If so, why is this not a foolproof gambling system ?Â
