# Are you still in the mood for betting ? Now let’s play something more interesting and serious! Let's try our skill at Russian roulette. Here's the conditions. I only have two bullets in my revolver, which has a 6-slot barrel.Now I put the bullets into the revolver in adjacent slots, spin the barrel and hand you the gun. You point the gun to your head. You pull the trigger and ... Click! you're still alive. Congratulations but the game is not over yet. You have to pull the trigger one last time. Now you have two choices. 1 You spin the barrel afterwards you pull the trigger. 2 You pull the trigger without spinning. Luckily you have some time and a computer with you in your bag so you can simulate the current situation such that you can choose the correct choice. 
# Your assignment is to calculate the probability for both cases and after you've found the probability for the initial conditions  you need also to find out what are the probabilities in case the bullets are not adjacent. Now you need to calculate the same probabilities but in case when you have 2 bullets and the gun has a 5 slots barrel. You have to present the result for 8 different outcomes. Good luck staying alive.
