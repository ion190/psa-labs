# At the Ziua Vinului, a coin toss game works as follows. Coins of 25 bani are tossed onto a checkerboard. The management keeps all the coins, but for each coin landing entirely within one square of the checkerboard the management pays 1 leu. Assume that the edge of each square is twice the diameter of a coin, and that the outcomes are described by coordinates chosen at random. Is this a fair game?
